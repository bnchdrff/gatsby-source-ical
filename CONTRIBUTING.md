# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to this package! Here are some things to consider when getting started in this repo.

## Setup

* Install dependencies by `npm install`.

## Development

* Ensure the babel runner is watching for changes: `npm run watch`.

* When committing use `npm run commit` instead of `git commit`. This will prompt you to input various fields for a [conventional commit message](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release#default-commit-message-format), which semantic-release uses to determine the next package version number when deploying to NPM (major, minor, patch).
